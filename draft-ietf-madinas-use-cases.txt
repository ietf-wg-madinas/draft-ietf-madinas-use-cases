Abstract

   To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a
   device, its traffic, its location, and its user, client and client
   Operation System vendors have started implementing MAC address
   randomization.  When such randomization happens, some in-network
   states may break, which may affect network connectivity and user
   experience.  At the same time, devices may continue using other
   stable identifiers, defeating the MAC address randomization purposes.

   This document lists various network environments and a set of network
   services that may be affected by such randomization.  This document
   then examines settings where the user experience may be affected by
   in-network state disruption.  Last, this document examines solutions
   to maintain user privacy while preserving user quality of experience
   and network operation efficiency.

1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.11 (or 'Wi-Fi') [IEEE_802.11] technology has revolutionized
   communications and become the preferred, and sometimes the only
   technology used by devices such as laptops, tablets and Internet-of-
   Thing (IoT) devices.  Wi-Fi is an over-the-air technology, attackers
   with surveillance equipment can "monitor" WLAN packets and track the
   activity of WLAN devices.  It is also sometimes possible for
   attackers to "monitor" the WLAN packers behind the Wi-Fi Access Point
   (AP) over the wired Ethernet.  Once the association between a device
   and its user is made, identifying the device and its activity is
   sufficient to deduce information about what the user is doing,

   without the user consent.

   To reduce the risks of correlation between a device activity and its
   owner's, multiple clients, and client OS vendors have started to
   implement Randomized and Changing MAC addresses (RCM).  By
   randomizing the MAC address, it becomes harder to use the MAC address
   to construct persistent association between a flow of data packets
   and a device, assuming no other visible unique identifiers or stable
   patterns are in use.  When individual devices are no longer easily
   identifiable, it also becomes difficult to associate a series of
   network packets with a particular individual using one particular
   device.

   However, such address change may affect the user experience and the
   efficiency of legitimate network operations.  For a long time,
   network designers and implementers relied on the assumption that a
   given machine, in a network implementing [IEEE_802] technologies,
   would be represented by a unique network MAC address that would not
   change over time, despite the existence of tools to flush out the MAC
   address to bypass some network policies.  When this assumption is
   broken, network communication may be disrupted.  For example,
   sessions established between the end-device and network services may
   break and packets in transit may suddenly be lost.  If multiple
   clients implement fast-paced MAC address randomization without
   coordination with network services, these network services may become
   over-solicited.

   At the same time, some network services rely on the end station (as
   defined by the [IEEE_802] Standard, also called in this document
   device, or machine) providing an identifier, which can be the MAC
   address or another value.  If the client implements MAC address
   randomization but continues sending the same static identifier, then
   the association between a stable identifier and the station continues
   despite the RCM scheme.  There may be environments where such
   continued association is desirable, but others where the user privacy
   has more value than any continuity of network service state.

   It could be useful to enumerate services that may be affected by RCM,
   and evaluate possible solutions to maintain both the quality of user
   experience and network efficiency while RCM happens and user privacy
   is reinforced.  This document presents such assessment and
   recommendations.

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 2 discusses the
   current status of using MAC address as Identity.  Section 3 discusses
   various actors in the network that will be impacted by the MAC
   address randomization.  Section 4 examines the Trust degrees.
   Section 5 discusses various network environments that will be

   impacted.  Section 6 analyzes some existing network services that
   will be impacted.  Finally, Appendix A includes some solutions that
   are being worked on.

2.  MAC Address as Identity: User vs. Device

   The Media Access Control (MAC) layer of IEEE 802 technologies defines
   rules to control how a device accesses the shared medium.  In a
   network where a machine can communicate with one or more other
   machines, one such rule is that each machine needs to be identified,
   either as the target destination of a message, or as the source of a
   message (and thus the target destination of the answer).  Initially
   intended as a 48-bit (6 octets) value in the first versions of the
   [IEEE_802] Standard, other Standards under the [IEEE_802] umbrella
   then allowed this address to take an extended format of 64 bits (8
   octets), thus enabling a larger number of MAC addresses to coexist as
   the 802 technologies became widely adopted.

   Regardless of the address length, different networks have different
   needs, and several bits of the first octet are reserved for specific
   purposes.  In particular, the first bit is used to identify the
   destination address either as an individual (bit set to 0) or a group
   address (bit set to 1).  The second bit, called the Universally or
   Locally Administered (U/L) Address Bit, indicates whether the address
   has been assigned by a local or administrator.  Universally
   administered addresses have this bit set to 0.  If this bit is set to
   1, the entire address is considered as locally administered (clause
   8.4 of [IEEE_802]).

   The intent of this provision is important for the present document.
   The [IEEE_802] Standard recognized that some devices (e.g., smart
   thermostat) may never change their attachment network and thus would
   not need a globally unique MAC address to prevent address collision
   against any other device in any other network.  The U/L bit can be
   set to signal to the network that the MAC Address is intended to be
   locally unique (not globally unique).  The 802 Standard [IEEE_802]
   didn't initially define the MAC Address allocation schema when the U/
   L bit is set to 1.  It states the address must be unique in a given
   broadcast domain (i.e., the space where the MAC addresses of devices
   are visible to one another).

   It is also important to note that the purpose of the Universal
   version of the address was to avoid collisions and confusion, as any
   machine could connect to any network, and each machine needs to
   determine if it is the intended destination of a message or its
   response.  Clause 8.4 of [IEEE_802] reminds network designers and
   operators that all potential members of a network need to have a
   unique identifier in that network (if they are going to coexist in



Henry & Lee                Expires 22 May 2025                  [Page 4]

   the network without confusion on which machine is the source or
   destination or any message).  The advantage of an administrated
   address is that a node with such an address can be attached to any
   Local Area Network (LAN) in the world with an assurance that its
   address is unique in that network.

   With the rapid development of wireless technologies and mobile
   devices, this scenario became very common.  With a vast majority of
   networks implementing [IEEE_802] radio technologies at the access,
   the MAC address of a wireless device can appear anywhere on the
   planet and collisions should still be avoided.  However, the same
   evolution brought the distinction between two types of devices that
   the [IEEE_802] Standard generally referred to as ‘nodes in a
   network’. Their definition is found in the [IEEE_802E] Recommended
   Practice stated in Section 6.2 of [IEEE_802].

   1.  Shared Service Device, which functions are used by a number of
       people large enough that the device itself, its functions or its
       traffic cannot be associated with a single or small group of
       people.  Examples of such devices include switches in a dense
       network, IEEE 802.11 (WLAN) access points in a crowded airport,
       task-specific (e.g., barcode scanners) devices, etc.

   2.  Personal Device, which is a machine, a node, primarily used by a
       single person or small group of people, and so that any
       identification of the device or its traffic can also be
       associated to the identification of the primary user or their
       traffic.

   The identification of the device is trivial if the device expresses a
   unique MAC address.  Then, the detection of elements directly or
   indirectly identifying the user of the device (Personally
   Identifiable Information, or PII) is sufficient to tie the MAC
   address to a user.  Then, any detection of traffic that can be
   associated to the device becomes also associated with the known user
   of that device (Personally Correlated Information, or PCI).

2.1.  Privacy of MAC Address

   This possible identification or association presents a privacy issue,
   especially with wireless technologies.  For most of them, and in
   particular for 802.11, the source and destination MAC addresses are
   not encrypted even in networks that implement encryption (so that
   each machine can easily detect if it is the intended target of the
   message before attempting to decrypt its content, and also identify
   the transmitter, so as to use the right decryption key when multiple
   unicast keys are in effect).

Internet-Draft                RCM Use Cases                November 2024


   This identification of the user associated to a node was clearly not
   the intent of the 802 MAC address.  A logical solution to remove this
   association is to use a locally administered address instead, and
   change the address in a fashion that prevents a continuous
   association between one MAC address and some PII.  However, other
   network devices on the same LAN implementing a MAC layer also expect
   each device to be associated to a MAC address that would persist over
   time.  When a device changes its MAC address, other devices on the
   same LAN may fail to recognize that the same machine is attempting to
   communicate with them.  Additionally, multiple layers implemented at
   upper OSI layers have been designed with the assumption that each
   node on the LAN, using these services, would have a MAC address that
   would stay the same over time, and that this document calls a
   'persistent' MAC address.  This assumption sometimes adds to the PII
   confusion, for example in the case of Authentication, Authorization
   and Accounting (AAA) services [RFC3539] authenticating the user of a
   machine and associating the authenticated user to the device MAC
   address.  Other services solely focus on the machine (e.g., DHCPv4
   [RFC2131]), but still expect each device to use a persistent MAC
   address, for example to re-assign the same IP address to a returning
   device.  Changing the MAC address may disrupt these services.

3.  The Actors: Network Functional Entities and Human Entities

   The risk of service disruption is thus weighted against the privacy
   benefits.  However, the plurality of actors involved in the exchanges
   tends to blur the boundaries of what privacy should be protected
   against.  It might therefore be useful to list the actors associated
   to the network exchanges, either because they actively participate to
   these exchanges, or because they can observe them.  Some actors are
   functional entities, some others are humans (or related) entities.

3.1.  Network Functional Entities

   Network communications based on IEEE 802 technologies commonly rely
   on station identifiers based on a MAC address.  This MAC address is
   utilized by several types of network functional entities (entities,
   like applications or devices, that provide a service related to
   network operations).

   1.  Wireless access network infrastructure devices (e.g., WLAN access
       points or controllers): these devices participate in IEEE 802 LAN
       operations.  As such, they need to identify each machine as a
       source or destination so as to successfully continue exchanging
       frames.  Part of the identification includes recording, and
       adapting to, devices communication capabilities (e.g., support
       for specific protocols).  As a device changes its network
       attachment (roams) from one access point to another, the access



Henry & Lee                Expires 22 May 2025                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                RCM Use Cases                November 2024


       points can exchange contextual information (e.g., device MAC,
       keying material) allowing the device session to continue
       seamlessly.  These access points can also inform devices further
       in the wired network about the roam, to ensure that layer-2
       frames are redirected to the new device access point.

   2.  Other network devices operating at the MAC layer: many wireless
       network access devices (e.g., IEEE 802.11 access points) are
       conceived as layer-2 devices, and as such they bridge a frame
       from one medium (e.g., IEEE 802.11 or Wi-Fi) to another
       (e.g.,IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet).  This means that a wireless device
       MAC address often exists on the wire beyond the wireless access
       device.  Devices connected to this wire also implement IEEE 802.3
       technologies, and as such operate on the expectation that each
       device is associated to a MAC address that persists for the
       duration of continuous exchanges.  For example, switches and
       bridges associate MAC addresses to individual ports (so as to
       know which port to send a frame intended for a particular MAC
       address).  Similarly, AAA services can validate the identity of a
       device and use the device MAC address as a first pointer to the
       device identity (before operating further verification).
       Similarly, some networking devices offer layer-2 filtering
       policies that may rely on the connected MAC addresses. 802.1X-
       enabled [IEEE_802.1X] devices may also selectively put the
       interface in blocking state until a connecting device is
       authenticated.  These services then use the MAC address as a
       first pointer to the device identity to allow or block data
       traffic.  This list is not exhaustive.  Multiple services are
       defined for 802.3 networks, and multiple services defined by the
       IEEE 802.1 working group are also applicable to 802.3 networks.
       Wireless access points may also connect to other mediums than
       802.3, which also implements mechanism under the umbrella of the
       general 802 Standard, and therefore expect the unique and
       persistent association of a MAC address to a device.

   3.  Network devices operating at upper layers: some network devices
       provide functions and services above the MAC layer.  Some of them
       also operate a MAC layer function: for example, routers provide
       IP forwarding services, but rely on the device MAC address to
       create the appropriate frame structure.  Other devices and
       services operate at upper layers, but also rely upon the 802
       principle of unique MAC-to- device mapping.  For example, Address
       Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC826] and Neighbor Discovery
       Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861] use MAC address to create the mapping of
       an IP address to a MAC address for packet forwarding.  If a
       device changes its MAC address without a mechanism to notify the
       layer-2 switch it is connected to or the provider of a service
       that expects a stable MAC-to-device mapping, the provider of the
       service and traffic forwarding may be disrupted.

3.2.  Human-related Entities

   Humans may actively participate to the network structure and
   operations, or be observers at any point of network lifecycle.
   Humans could be wireless device users or people operating the
   wireless networks.

   1.  Over the air (OTA) observers: as the transmitting or receiving
       MAC address is usually not encrypted in wireless 802-technologies
       exchanges, and as any protocol-compatible device in range of the
       signal can read the frame header, OTA observers are able to read
       individual transmissions MAC addresses.  Some wireless
       technologies also support techniques to establish distances or
       positions, allowing the observer, in some cases, to uniquely
       associate the MAC address to a physical device and it associated
       location.  It can happen that an OTA observer has a legitimate
       reason to monitor a particular device, for example for IT support
       operations.  However, it is difficult to control if another actor
       also monitors the same station with the goal of obtaining PII or
       PCI.

   2.  Wireless access network operators: some wireless access networks
       are only provided devices matching specific requirements, such as
       device type (e.g., IoT-only networks, factory operational
       networks).  Therefore, operators can attempt to identify the
       devices (or the users) connecting to the networks under their
       care.  They can use the MAC address to represent an identified
       device.

   3.  Network access providers: wireless access networks are often
       considered beyond the first 2 layers of the OSI model.  For
       example, several regulatory or legislative bodies can group all
       OSI layers into their functional effect of allowing network



Henry & Lee                Expires 22 May 2025                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                RCM Use Cases                November 2024


       communication between machines.  In this context, entities
       operating access networks can see their liability associated to
       the activity of devices communicating through the networks that
       these entities operate.  In other contexts, operators assign
       network resources based on contractual conditions (e.g., fee,
       bandwidth fair share).  In these scenarios, these operators may
       attempt to identify the devices and the users of their networks.
       They can use the MAC address to represent an identified device.

   4.  Over the wire internal (OTWi) observers: because the device
       wireless MAC address continues to be present over the wire if the
       infrastructure connection device (e.g., access point) functions
       as a layer-2 bridge, observers may be positioned over the wire
       and read transmission MAC addresses.  Such capability supposes
       that the observer has access to the wired segment of the
       broadcast domain where the frames are exchanged.  A Broadcast
       Domain is a logical division of a network where a device in the
       division can send, receive and monitor data frames from all
       devices in the same division.  In most networks, such capability
       requires physical access to an infrastructure wired device in the
       broadcast domain (e.g., switch closet), and is therefore not
       accessible to all.

   5.  Over the wired external (OTWe) observers: beyond the broadcast
       domain, frames headers are removed by a routing device, and a new
       layer-2 header is added before the frame is transmitted to the
       next segment.  The personal device MAC address is not visible
       anymore, unless a mechanism copies the MAC address into a field
       that can be read while the packet travels onto the next segment
       (e.g., pre- [RFC4941] and pre-[RFC7217] IPv6 addresses built from
       the MAC address).  Therefore, unless this last condition exists,
       OTWe observers are not able to see the device MAC address.

4.  Trust Degrees

   The surface of PII exposures that can drive MAC address randomization
   depends on (1) the environment where the device operates, (2) the
   presence and nature of other devices in the environment, and (3) the
   type of network the device is communicating through.  Therefore, a
   device can express an identifier (such as a MAC address) that can
   persist over time if trust with the environment is established, or
   that can be temporal if an identifier is required for a service in an
   environment where trust has not been established.  Trust is not a
   binary currency.  Thus it is useful to distinguish what trust a
   personal device may establish with the different entities at play in
   a network domain where a MAC address may be visible:

Internet-Draft                RCM Use Cases                November 2024


   1.  Full trust: there are environments where a personal device
       establishes a trust relationship and can share a persistent
       device identity with the access network devices (e.g., access
       point and WLAN Controller), the services beyond the access point
       in the layer-2 broadcast domain (e.g., DHCPv4, AAA), without fear
       that observers or network actors may access PII that would not be
       shared willingly.  The personal device (or its user) also has
       confidence that its identity is not shared beyond the layer-2
       broadcast domain boundary.

   2.  Selective trust: in other environments, a device may not be
       willing to share a persistent identity with some elements of the
       layer-2 broadcast domain, but may be willing to share a
       persistent identity with other elements.  That persistent
       identity may or may not be the same for different services.

   3.  Zero trust: in other environments, a device may not be willing to
       share any persistent identity with any local entity reachable
       through the AP, and may express a temporal identity to each of
       them.  That temporal identity may or not be the same for
       different services.

5.  Environments

   The trust relationship depends on the relationship between the user
   of a personal device and the operator of a network service that the
   personal device may use.  Thus, it is useful to observe the typical
   trust structure of common environments:

   A.  Residential settings under the control of the user: this is
       typical of a home network with Wi-Fi in the LAN and Internet
       connection.  In this environment, traffic over the Internet does
       not expose the MAC address of internal device if it is not copied
       to another field before routing happens.  The wire segment within
       the broadcast domain is under the control of the user, and is
       therefore usually not at risk of hosting an eavesdropper.  Full
       trust is typically established at this level among users and with
       the network elements.  The device trusts the access point and all
       layer-2 domain entities beyond the access point.  However, unless
       the user has full access control over the physical space where
       the Wi-Fi transmissions can be detected, there is no guarantee
       that an eavesdropper would not be observing the communications.
       As such, it is common to assume that, even in this environment,
       full trust cannot be achieved.

   B.  Managed residential settings: examples of this type of
       environment include shared living facilities and other collective
       environments where an operator manages the network for the

       residents.  The OTA exposure is similar to that of a home.  A
       number of devices larger than in a standard home may be present,
       and the operator may be requested to provide IT support to the
       residents.  Therefore, the operator may need to identify a device
       activity in real time, but may also need to analyze logs so as to
       understand a past reported issue.  For both activities, a device
       identification associated to the session is needed.  Full trust
       is often established in this environment, at the scale of a
       series of a few sessions, not because it is assumed that no
       eavesdropper would observe the network activity, but because it
       is a common condition for the managed operations.

   C.  Public guest networks: public hotspots, such as in shopping
       malls, hotels, stores, train-stations, and airports are typical
       of this environment.  The guest network operator may be legally
       mandated to identify devices or users or may have the option to
       leave all devices and users untracked.  In this environment,
       trust is commonly not established with any element of the layer-2
       broadcast domain (Zero trust model by default).

   D.  Enterprises with Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): users may be
       provided with corporate devices or may bring their own devices.
       The devices are not directly under the control of a corporate IT
       team.  Trust may be established as the device joins the network.
       Some enterprise models will mandate full trust, others,
       considering the BYOD nature of the device, will allow selective
       trust.

   E.  Managed enterprises: in this environment, users are typically
       provided with corporate devices, and all connected devices are
       managed, for example through a Mobile Device Management (MDM)
       profile installed on the device.  Full trust is created as the
       MDM profile is installed.

6.  Network Services

   Different network environments provide different levels of network
   services, from simple to complex.  At its simplest level, a network
   can provide to a wireless connecting device basic IP communication
   service (e.g., DHCPv4 [RFC2131] or SLAAC [RFC4862]) and an ability to
   connect to the Internet (e.g., DNS service or relay, and routing in
   and out through a local gateway).  The network can also offer more
   advanced services, such as file storage, printing, or local web
   service.  Larger and more complex networks can also incorporate a
   multiplicity of more advanced services, from AAA, to Quality of
   Experience monitoring and management.  These services are often
   accompanied with network performance management services.  Different
   levels of services may call for different relationships with the

   device, its user, and the identity.  For example, there is usually no
   need to identify the device or its user in a public network.
   However, there may be a need, in an enterprise private network, to
   associate a device to an identity in order to provide adapted quality
   of services (e.g., to prioritize identified voice traffic coming from
   a smartphone over keepalive data coming from an IoT endpoint).  The
   same type of network may have a need to limit the effect of IP
   address spoofing and invalid reuse through mechanisms like SAVI
   [RFC6620].

6.1.  Device Identification and Associated Problems

   Wireless access points and controllers use the MAC address to
   validate the device connection context, including protocol
   capabilities, confirmation that authentication was completed, Quality
   of Service or security profiles, encryption key material.  Some
   advanced access points and controllers also include upper layer
   functions which purpose is covered below.  A device changing its MAC
   address, without another recorded device identity, would cause the
   access point and the controller to lose these parameters.  As such,
   the layer-2 infrastructure does not know that the device (with its
   new MAC address) is authorized to communicate through the network.
   The encryption keying material is not identified anymore (causing the
   access point to fail decrypting the device traffic, and fail
   selecting the right key to send encrypted traffic to the device).  In
   short, the entire context needs to be rebuilt, and a new session
   restarted.  The time consumed by this procedure breaks any flow that
   needs continuity or short delay between packets on the device (e.g.,
   real-time audio, video, AR/VR, etc.)  The 802.11i Standard
   [IEEE_802.11i] recognizes that a device may leave the network and
   come back after a short time window.  As such, the standard suggests
   that the infrastructure should keep the context for a device for a
   while after the device was last seen.  MAC address randomization in
   this context can cause resource exhaustion on the wireless
   infrastructure and the flush of contexts, including for devices that
   are simply in temporal sleep mode.

Internet-Draft                RCM Use Cases                November 2024


   Some network equipments such as Multi-Layer router and Wi-Fi Access
   Point which serve both layer-2 and layer-3 in the same device rely on
   ARP [RFC826] and NDP [RFC4861], to build the MAC-to-IP table for
   packet forwarding.  Aggressive MAC randomization from many devices in
   a short time-interval may cause the layer-2 switch to exhaust its
   resources, holding in memory traffic for a device which port location
   can no longer be found.  As these infrastructure devices also
   implement a cache (to remember the port position of each known
   device), too frequent randomized MAC address changes can cause
   resources exhaustion and the flush of older MAC addresses, including
   for devices that did not change their MAC to a new randomized value.
   For the RCM device, these effects translate into session
   discontinuity and return traffic losses.

   In wireless contexts, 802.1X [IEEE_802.1X] authenticators rely on the
   device and user identity validation provided by a AAA server to
   change the interface from blocking state to forwarding state.  The
   MAC address is used to verify that the device is in the authorized
   list, and the associated key used to decrypt the device traffic.  A
   change in MAC address causes the port to be closed to the device data
   traffic until the AAA server confirms the validity of the new MAC
   address.  Therefore, MAC address randomization can interrupt the
   device traffic, and cause a strain on the AAA server.

   DHCPv4 servers, without a unique identification of the device, lose
   track of which IP address is validly assigned.  Unless the RCM device
   releases the IP address before changing its MAC address, DHCPv4
   servers are at risk of scope exhaustion, causing new devices (and RCM
   devices) to fail to obtain a new IP address.  Even if the RCM device
   releases the IP address before changing the MAC address, the DHCPv4
   server typically holds the released IP address for a certain
   duration, in case the leaving MAC would return.  As the DHCPv4 server
   cannot know if the release is due to a temporal disconnection or a
   MAC randomization, the risk of scope address exhaustion exists even
   in cases where the IP address is released.

   Network devices with self-assigned IPv6 addresses (e.g., with SLAAC
   defined in [RFC6620]) and devices using static IP addresses rely on
   mechanisms like Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
   [RFC4429] and NDP [RFC4861] for peer devices to establish the
   association between the target IP address and a MAC address, and
   these peers may cache this association in memory.  Changing the MAC
   address, even through a disconnection-reconnection phase, without
   changing the IP address, may disrupt the stability of these mappings
   for these peers, if the change occurs within the caching period.

Internet-Draft                RCM Use Cases                November 2024


   Routers keep track of which MAC address is on which interface, so
   they can form the proper Data Link header when forwarding a packet to
   a segment where MAC addresses are used.  MAC address randomization
   can cause MAC address cache exhaustion, but also the need for
   frequent ARP, inverse ARP [RFC826], Neighbor Solicitation and,
   Neighbor Advertisement [RFC4861] exchanges.

   In residential settings (environments type A in section Section 5),
   policies can be in place to control the traffic of some devices
   (e.g., parental control or block-list filters).  These policies are
   often based on the device MAC address.  MAC address randomization
   removes the possibility for such control.

   In residential settings (environments type A) and in enterprises
   (environments types D and E), device recognition and ranging may be
   used for IoT-related functionalities (door unlock, preferred light
   and temperature configuration, etc.)  These functions often rely on
   the detection of the device wireless MAC address.  MAC address
   randomization breaks the services based on such model.

   In managed residential settings (environments types B) and in
   enterprises (environments types D and E), the network operator is
   often requested to provide IT support.  With MAC address
   randomization, real time support is only possible if the user is able
   to provide the current MAC address.  Service improvement support is
   not possible if the MAC address that the device had at the (past)
   time of the reported issue is not known at the time the issue is
   reported.

   In industrial environments, policies are associated to each group of
   objects, including IoT.  MAC address randomization may prevent an IoT
   device from being identified properly, thus leading to network
   quarantine and disruption of operations.

                             Table 1: Use Cases

   For example: a Home network is sometimes considered to be trusted and
   safe, where users are not worried about other users (or the home
   network admin) seeing their MAC address.  Users expect a simple
   procedure to connect to their home network.  All devices in the home
   network often trust each other.  The Home network can also include
   many IoT devices, which need to be simple to onboard and manage.  The
   home user commonly expects the network operator to protect the home
   network from external threats (i.e., attacks from the Internet).  The
   home user also commonly expects simple policy features (e.g.,
   Parental Control).  Most home users do not expect to need networking
   skills to manage their home network.  Such environments may lead to
   full-trust conditions.  However, if the trust commonly exists between
   allowed actors, there is no guarantee that an eavesdropper would not
   be observing the Wi-Fi traffic from outside, thus practically
   limiting the applicability of the trust in most home scenarios.

   On the other end of the spectrum, Public Wi-Fi is often considered to
   be completely untrusted, where a user has no expectation of being
   able to trust other users or any actor inside or outside of the
   layer-2 domain.  Privacy is the number one concern for the user.
   Most users connecting to Public Wi-Fi only require simple Internet
   connectivity service, and expect only limited to no technical
   support.

Appendix A.  Existing Solutions

A.1.  802.1X with WPA2 / WPA3

   At the time of association to a Wi-Fi access point, 802.1X
   [IEEE_802.1X] authentication coupled with WPA2 or WPA3 [IEEE_802.11i]
   encryption schemes allows for the mutual identification of the client
   device or of the user of the device and an authentication authority.
   The authentication exchange does not occur in clear text, and the
   user or the device identity can be obfuscated from unauthorized
   observers.  However, the authentication authority is in most cases
   under the control of the same entity as the network access provider,
   thus making the user or device identity visible to the network owner.

   This scheme is therefore well-adapted to enterprise environments,
   where a level of trust is established between the user and the
   enterprise network operator.  In this scheme, MAC address
   randomization can occur through brief disconnections and
   reconnections (under the rules of [IEEE_802.11bh]).  Authentication
   may then need to reoccur, with an associated cost of service
   disruption and additional load on the enterprise infrastructure, and
   an associated benefit of limiting the exposure of a continuous MAC
   address to external observers.  The adoption of this scheme is
   however limited outside of the enterprise environment by the
   requirement to install an authentication profile on the end device,
   that would be recognized and accepted by a local authentication
   authority and its authentication server.  Such server is uncommon in
   a home environment, and the procedure to install a profile cumbersome
   for most untrained users.  The likelihood that a user or device
   profile would match a profile recognized by a public Wi-Fi
   authentication authority is also fairly limited, thus restricting the
   adoption of this scheme for public Wi-Fi as well.  Similar
   limitations are found in hospitality environments.

A.2.  OpenRoaming

   In order to alleviate some of the limitations listed above, the
   Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA) OpenRoaming Standard introduces an
   intermediate trusted relay between local venues (places where some
   public Wi-Fi is available) and sources of identity
   [draft-tomas-openroaming].  The federation structure also extends the
   type of authorities that can be used as identity sources (compared to
   traditional enterprise-based 802.1X [IEEE_802.1X] scheme for Wi-Fi),
   and also facilitates the establishment of trust between local network
   and an identity provider.  Such procedure increases the likelihood
   that one or more identity profiles for the user or the device will be
   recognized by a local network.  At the same time, authentication does
   not occur to the local network, thus offering the possibility for the
   user or the device to keep their identity obfuscated from the local
   network operator, unless that operator specifically expresses the
   requirement to disclose such identity (in which case the user has the
   option to accept or decline the connection and associated identity
   exposure).

   The OpenRoaming scheme therefore seems well-adapted to public Wi-Fi
   and hospitality environments, allowing for the obfuscation of the
   identity from unauthorized entities, while also permitting mutual
   authentication between the device or the user and a trusted identity
   provider.  Just like with standard 802.1X [IEEE_802.1X] scheme for
   Wi-Fi, authentication allows the establishment of WPA2 or WPA3 keys
   [IEEE_802.11i] that can then be used to encrypt the communication
   between the device and the access point, thus obfuscating the traffic
   from observers.

   MAC address randomization can occur through brief disconnections and
   reconnections (under the rules of [IEEE_802.11bh]).  Authentication
   may then need to reoccur, with an associated cost of service
   disruption and additional load on the venue and identity provider
   infrastructure, and an associated benefit of limiting the exposure of
   a continuous MAC address to external observers.  Limitations of this
   scheme include the requirement to first install one or more profiles
   on the client device.  This scheme also requires the local network to
   support RADSEC [RFC6614] and the relay function, which may not be
   common in small hotspot networks and in home environments.

   It is worth noting that, as part of collaborations between IETF
   MADINAS and WBA around OpenRoaming, some RADIUS privacy enhancements
   have been proposed in the IETF RADEXT group.  For instance,
   [I-D.ietf-radext-deprecating-radius] describes good practices in the
   use of Chargeable-User-Identity (CUI) between different visited
   networks, making it better suited for Public Wi-Fi and Hospitality
   use cases.

A.3.  Proprietary RCM schemes

   Most client device operating system vendors offer RCM schemes,
   enabled by default (or easy to enable) on client devices.  With these
   schemes, the device changes its MAC address, when not associated,
   after having used a given MAC address for a semi-random duration
   window.  These schemes also allow for the device to manifest a
   different MAC address in different SSIDs.

   Such randomization scheme enables the device to limit the duration of
   exposure of a single MAC address to observers.  In [IEEE_802.11bh],
   MAC address randomization is not allowed during a given association
   session, and thus MAC address randomization can only occur through
   disconnection and reconnection.  Authentication may then need to
   reoccur, with an associated cost of service disruption and additional
   load on the venue and identity provider infrastructure, directly
   proportional to the frequency of the randomization.  The scheme is
   also not intended to protect from the exposure of other identifiers
   to the venue network (e.g., DHCP option 012 [host name] visible to
   the network between the AP and the DHCPv4 server).
