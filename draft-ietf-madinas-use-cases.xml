         <t>To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a device, its traffic, its location, and its user in
         <xref target="IEEE_802"/> networks,
         client and client Operating System vendors have started implementing MAC address randomization. This technology is
         particularly important in Wi-Fi <xref target="IEEE_802.11" /> networks due to the over-the-air medium and device mobility.
         When such randomization
         happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network connectivity and user experience.
         At the same time, devices may continue using other stable identifiers, defeating the MAC address randomization purposes.</t>
         
         <t>This document lists various network environments and a range of network services that may be affected
         by such randomization. This document then examines settings where the user experience may be affected by in-network
         state disruption. Last, this document examines two existing frameworks to maintain user privacy while preserving user 
         quality of experience and network operation efficiency.</t>

         <name>Introduction</name>
         <t>When MAC-Address was first introduced in <xref target="IEEE_802"/> Standard, it was used in wired 
         Ethernet network <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/>. Due to the nature of
         the wired network, devices were relatively stationary and the physical connection imposed a boundary to restrict attackers
         to easily access the network data. But <xref target="IEEE_802.11" /> (Wi-Fi) brought new challenges when it was introduced.  
         </t>

         <t>The flexibility of Wi-Fi technology has revolutionized communications and become the
         preferred, and sometimes the only technology used by devices such as laptops, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT)
         devices.  Wi-Fi is an over-the-air medium that allows attackers with surveillance equipment to monitor WLAN packets and
         track the activity of WLAN devices. It is also sometimes possible for attackers to monitor the WLAN packets behind the Wi-Fi
         Access Point (AP) over the wired Ethernet. Once the association between a device and its user is made, identifying the 
         device and its activity is sufficient to deduce information about what the user is doing, without the user's consent.</t>

         <t>To reduce the risks of identifying a device only by the MAC address, client OS 
         vendors have started implementing Randomized and Changing MAC addresses (RCM). By randomizing the MAC address,
         it becomes harder to use the MAC address to construct a persistent association between a flow of data packets and a device, 
         assuming no other visible unique identifiers or stable patterns are in use. When individual devices are no longer easily 
         identifiable, it also becomes difficult 
         to associate a series of network packet flows in a prolonged period with a particular individual using one specific device
         if the device randomizes the MAC address governed by the OS privacy policies.</t>

         <t>However, such address change may affect the user experience and the efficiency of legitimate
         network operations. For a long time, network designers and implementers relied on the assumption that a given machine,
         in a network implementing <xref target="IEEE_802"/> technologies, would be represented by a unique network MAC address that would not
         change over time. When this assumption is broken, network communication may be disrupted.
         For example, sessions established between the end-device and network services may break and
         packets in transit may suddenly be lost. If multiple clients implement aggressive (e.g., once an hour or shorter) 
         MAC address randomization without coordination with network services, some network services such as MAC address cache in
         the AP and the upstream layer-2 switch may not be able to handle the load that may result in unexpected network interruption.</t>

         <t>At the same time, some network services rely on the end station (as defined by the <xref target="IEEE_802"/> Standard,
         also called in this document device, or machine) providing an identifier, which can be
         the MAC address or another value. If the client implements MAC address randomization but continues sending the same static
         identifier, then the association between a stable identifier and the station continues despite the RCM scheme.
         There may be environments where such continued association is desirable, but others where user privacy has
         more value than any continuity of network service state.</t>

         <t>It is useful for implementations of client and network devices to enumerate services that may be
         affected by RCM and evaluate possible framework to maintain both the quality of user experience
         and network efficiency while RCM happens, and user privacy is strengthened. This document
         presents these assessments and recommendations.</t>

         <t> Although this document mainly discusses MAC-Address randomization in Wi-Fi <xref target="IEEE_802.11" /> networks, 
         same principles can be easily extended to any <xref target="IEEE_802.3" /> networks.</t>

         <t>This document is organized as follows. <xref target="identity"/> discusses the current status of using MAC 
         address as identity. <xref target="actors"/> discusses various actors in the network that will be impacted by MAC
         address randomization. <xref target="trust"/> examines the degrees of trust between personal
         devices and the entities at play in a network domain. <xref target="environment"/> discusses various network 
         environments that will be impacted. <xref target="services"/> analyzes some existing 
         network services that will be impacted. Finally, <xref target="framework"/> includes some frameworks that are 
         being worked on.</t>

         <name>MAC Address as Identity: User vs. Device</name>
         <t>The Media Access Control (MAC) layer of IEEE 802.3 <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/> 
         technologies define rules to control how a device accesses the shared medium. In a
         network where a machine can communicate with one or more other machines, one such rule is that each
         machine needs to be identified either as the target destination of a message or as the source of a
         message (and the target destination of the answer). Initially intended as a 48-bit (6 octets)
         value in the first versions of the <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/> Standard, other Standards under
         the <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/> umbrella allow this address to take an extended
         format of 64 bits (8 octets) which enable a larger number of MAC addresses to coexist as the
         802.3 technologies became widely adopted.</t>

         <t>Regardless of the address length, different networks have different needs, and several bits of
         the first octet are reserved for specific purposes. In particular, the first bit is used to identify
         the destination address as an individual (bit set to 0) or a group address (bit set to 1). The
         second bit, called the Universally or Locally Administered (U/L) Address Bit, indicates whether the address
         has been assigned by a universal or local administrator. Universally administered addresses have this
         bit set to 0. If this bit is set to 1, the entire address is considered locally administered
         (clause 8.4 of <xref target="IEEE_802"/>). Note that universally administered MAC addresses are 
         required to register to IEEE while locally administered MAC addresses are not.</t>

         <t>The intent of this provision is important for the present document. The <xref target="IEEE_802"/>
         Standard recognized that some devices (e.g., smart thermostats) may never change their attachment network 
         and will not need a globally unique MAC address to prevent address collision against any other 
         device in any other network. The U/L bit can be set to signal to the network that the MAC Address is intended
         to be locally unique (not globally unique). <xref target="IEEE_802"/>
         did not initially define the MAC Address allocation schema when the U/L bit is set to 1. It states the address must 
         be unique in a given broadcast domain (i.e., the space where the MAC addresses of devices are visible to one
         another).</t>

         <t>It is also important to note that the purpose of the Universal version of the address was
         to avoid collisions and confusion, as any machine could connect to any network, and each machine needs
         to determine if it is the intended destination of a message or its response. Clause 8.4 of <xref target="IEEE_802"/>
         reminds network designers and operators that all potential members of a network need to have a unique
         identifier in that network (if they are going to coexist in the network without confusion on which
         machine is the source or destination or any message). The advantage of an administrated address is
         that a node with such an address can be attached to any Local Area Network (LAN) in the world with an assurance that its
         address is unique in that network.</t>

         <t>With the rapid development of wireless technologies and mobile devices, this scenario became
         very common. With a vast majority of networks implementing <xref target="IEEE_802"/> radio technologies at
         the access, the MAC address of a wireless device can appear anywhere on the planet and collisions
         should still be avoided. However, the same evolution brought the distinction between two types of
         devices that the <xref target="IEEE_802"/> Standard generally referred to as ‘nodes in a network’. Their definition is
         found in the <xref target="IEEE_802E" /> Recommended Practice stated in Section 6.2 of <xref target="IEEE_802"/>.</t>
         
         <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
            <li> Shared Service Device, whose
            functions are used by enough people that the device itself, functions, or its
            traffic cannot be associated with a single or small group of people. Examples of such devices include
            switches in a dense network, <xref target="IEEE_802.11"/> (WLAN) access points in a crowded airport, task-specific
            device (e.g., barcode scanners).</li>

            <li> Personal Device, which is a machine or node
            primarily used by a single person or small group of people, and so that any identification of the
            device or its traffic can also be associated with the identification of the primary user or their 
            online activity.
            </li>
         </ol>

         <t>Identifying the device is trivial if it has a 
         unique MAC address. Once this unique MAC address is established, detecting any elements that 
         directly or indirectly identify
         the user of the device (Personally Identifiable Information, or PII) is enough to link the
         MAC address to that user. Then, any detection of traffic that can be associated with the
         device will also be linked to the known user of that device (Personally Correlated
         Information, or PCI).</t>

         <section anchor="privacy" numbered="true" toc="default">
         <name>Privacy of MAC Address</name>
         <t>This possible identification or association presents a privacy issue,
         especially with wireless technologies. For most of them, and in particular for <xref target="IEEE_802.11"/>, the
         source and destination MAC addresses are not encrypted even in networks that implement encryption
         (so that each machine can easily detect if it is the intended target of the message before attempting
         to decrypt its content, and also identify the transmitter, to use the right decryption key when multiple
         unicast keys are in effect).</t>

         <t>This identification of the user associated with a node was clearly not the intent of the
         802 MAC address. A logical solution to remove this association is to use a locally administered
         address instead and change the address in a fashion that prevents a continuous association between
         one MAC address and some PII. However, other network devices on the
         same LAN implementing a MAC layer also expect each device to be associated with a MAC address that would
         persist over time. When a device changes
         its MAC address, other devices on the same LAN may fail to recognize that the same machine is attempting
         to communicate with them. This type of MAC addresses is referred to as 'persistent' MAC address
         in this document. This
         assumption sometimes adds to the PII confusion, for example in the case of Authentication, Authorization,
         and Accounting (AAA) services <xref target="RFC3539"/> authenticating
         the user of a machine and associating the authenticated user to the device MAC address. Other services
         solely focus on the machine (e.g., DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"/>), but still expect each device to use a 
         persistent MAC address, for example to re-assign the same IP address to a returning device.
         Changing the MAC address may disrupt these services.</t>

         <name>The Actors: Network Functional Entities and Human Entities</name>
         <t>The risk of service disruption is weighed against the privacy benefits. However, the plurality
         of actors involved in the exchanges tends to blur the boundaries of what privacy violations should be
         protected against. It is therefore useful to list the actors associated with the network exchanges,
         either because they actively participate in these exchanges, or because they can observe them.
         Some actors are functional entities, while some others are human (or related) entities.</t>

         <section numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Network Functional Entities</name>
            <t>Network communications based on IEEE 802 technologies commonly rely on station identifiers based on a
              MAC address. This MAC address is utilized by several types of network functional entities 
              such as applications or devices that provide a service related to network operations.</t>

            <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
            <li>Wireless access network infrastructure devices (e.g., WLAN access points or controllers): these
            devices participate in IEEE 802 LAN operations. As such, they need to identify each machine as a source
            or destination to successfully continue exchanging frames.
            As a device changes its network attachment (roams) from one access point to another, the access points can
            exchange contextual information, (e.g., device MAC, keying material), allowing the device session to
            continue seamlessly. These access points can also inform devices further in the wired network about
            the roam to ensure that layer-2 frames are redirected to the new device access point.</li>

            <li> Other network devices operating at the MAC layer: many wireless network access devices 
            (e.g., <xref target="IEEE_802.11"/> access points) are conceived as layer-2 devices, and as such, they bridge a frame
            from one medium (e.g., <xref target="IEEE_802.11"/> or Wi-Fi) to another (e.g., <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/>
            or Ethernet).  This means that 
            a wireless device MAC address often exists on the wire beyond the wireless access
            device.  Devices connected to this wire also implement  <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/>  technologies and, 
            as such, operate 
            on the expectation that each device is associated with a MAC address that persists for the duration of 
            continuous exchanges.  For example, switches and bridges associate MAC addresses to individual ports 
            (so as to know to which port to send a frame intended for a particular MAC
            address).  Similarly, AAA services can validate the identity of a device and use the device's MAC address
            as a first pointer to the device identity (before operating further verification).
            Similarly, some networking devices offer layer-2 filtering policies that may rely on the connected MAC 
            addresses. 802.1X-enabled <xref target="IEEE_802.1X"/> devices may also selectively put the
            interface in a blocking state until a connecting device is authenticated.  These services then use the MAC 
            address as a first pointer to the device identity to allow or block data traffic.  This list is not 
            exhaustive.  Multiple services are defined for <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/> networks, and multiple services defined by the
            IEEE 802.1 working group are also applicable to <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/> networks. Wireless access points may also connect 
            to other mediums than <xref target="IEEE_802.3"/> (e.g., DOCSIS <xref target="DOCSIS"/>), 
            which also implements mechanisms under the umbrella of the general 802 
            Standard, and therefore expect the unique and persistent association of a MAC address to a device.</li>

            <li>Network devices operating at upper layers: some network devices
            provide functions and services above the MAC layer.  Some of them
            also operate a MAC layer function: for example, routers provide
            IP forwarding services but rely on the device MAC address to
            create the appropriate frame structure.  Other devices and
            services operate at upper layers but also rely upon the 802
            principles of unique MAC-to-device mapping.  For example, Address
            Resolution Protocol (ARP) <xref target="RFC826"/> and Neighbor Discovery
            Protocol (NDP) <xref target="RFC4861"/> use MAC address to create the mapping of
            an IP address to a MAC address for packet forwarding.  If a
            device changes its MAC address without a mechanism to notify the
            layer-2 switch it is connected to or the provider of a service
            that expects a stable MAC-to-device mapping, the provider of the
            service and traffic forwarding may be disrupted.

            <t>Humans may actively participate in the network structure and operations, or be observers at any point
            of the network lifecycle. Humans could be wireless device users or people operating wireless networks.</t>

            <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
               <li>Over-The-Air (OTA) observers: as the transmitting or receiving MAC address is usually not encrypted
               in wireless 802-technologies exchanges, and as any protocol-compatible device in range of the signal
               can read the frame header. As such OTA observers are able to read the MAC addresses of individual transmissions. 
               Some
               wireless technologies also support techniques to establish distances or positions, allowing the observer,
               in some cases, to uniquely associate the MAC address with a physical device and its associated location.
               An OTA observer may have a legitimate reason to monitor a particular device, for example, 
               for IT support operations. However, another actor might also monitor the same device to 
               obtain PII or PCI.</li>

               <li>Wireless access network operators: some wireless access networks host
               devices that meet specific requirements, such as device type (e.g., IoT-only networks, factory operational
               networks). Therefore, operators can attempt to identify the devices (or the users) connecting to the
               networks under their care. They often use the MAC address to represent an identified device.</li>

               <li>Network access providers: wireless access networks are often considered beyond the first 2 layers of
               the OSI model. For example, law enforcement agency (e.g., FBI in the United States) may legally require 
               the network access provider to 
               identify communications from a subject. In this context, the
               operating access networks need to identify the devices used by the subjects and cross-reference the 
               data generated by the devices in the network. In other contexts, the operating access networks assign
               resources based on contractual conditions (e.g., fee, bandwidth fair share). In these scenarios,
               the operators may use the MAC address to identify the devices and the users of their networks.</li>

               <li>Over-The-Wired internal (OTWi) observers: because the device wireless MAC address continues to be
               present over the wire if the infrastructure connection device (e.g., access point) functions as a layer-2 
               bridge, observers may be positioned over the wire and read transmission MAC addresses. Such capability
               supposes that the observer has access to the wired segment of the broadcast domain where the frames
               are exchanged. A broadcast domain is a logical segment of a network in which devices 
               can send, receive, and monitor data frames from all other devices within the same segment.  
               In most networks, such capability requires physical access to an infrastructure wired
               device in the broadcast domain (e.g., switch closet), and is therefore not accessible to all.</li>

               <li>Over-The-Wired external (OTWe) observers: beyond the broadcast domain, frame headers are removed
               by a routing device, and a new layer-2 header is added before the frame is transmitted to the next
               segment. The device MAC address is not visible anymore unless a mechanism copies the MAC
               address into a field that can be read while the packet travels onto the next segment (e.g., pre-
               <xref target="RFC4941" /> and pre-<xref target="RFC7217" />
               IPv6 addresses built from the MAC address). Therefore, unless this last condition exists,
               OTWe observers are not able to see the device's MAC address.

         <name>Degrees of Trust</name>
         <t>The surface of PII exposures that can drive MAC address randomization depends on (1) the
        environment where the device operates, (2) the presence and nature of other devices in the
        environment, and (3) the type of network the device is communicating through. Consequently, a device
        can use an identifier (such as a MAC address) that can persist over time if trust with the
        environment is established, or that can be temporary if an identifier is required
        for a service in an environment where trust has not been established. Note that trust is not binary.
        It is useful to distinguish what trust a personal device may establish with the different entities
        at play in a network domain where a MAC address may be visible:</t>

         <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
            <li>Full trust: there is environment where a device establishes a trust relationship, and the device 
            can share its persistent
            MAC address with the access network devices (e.g., access point and WLAN Controller). In this environment,
            the network provides necessary security measurement to prevent observers or network actors from 
            accessing PII. The device (or its user) also has confidence that its
            MAC address is not shared beyond the layer-2 broadcast domain boundary.</li>

            <li>Selective trust: in another environment, depending of the pre-defined privacy policies, a device may 
            decide to use one pseudo-persistent MAC address for a set of network elements and another pseudo-persistent 
            MAC address for another set of network elements. Examples of privacy policies can be SSID and BSSID combination, 
            a particular time-of-day, or a pre-set time duration.
            </li>

            <li>Zero trust: in another environment, a device may randomize its MAC address with any local entity
            reachable through the AP. It may generate a temporary MAC address to each of them. That temporary
            MAC address may or may not be the same for different services.</li>
         </ol>
      </section>

      <section anchor="environment" numbered="true" toc="default">
         <name>Environment</name>
         <t>The trust relationship depends on the relationship between the user of a personal device
         and the operator of a network service that the personal device may use. It is useful to observe the typical trust 
         structure of common environments:</t>
        
        <ol spacing="normal" type="A">
            <li>Residential settings under the control of the user: this is a typical home network with Wi-Fi in the LAN and
            Internet in the WAN.
            In this environment, traffic over the Internet does not expose the MAC address of 
            the internal device if it is not copied to
            another field before routing happens. The wire segment within the broadcast domain is under the control of the user
            and is usually not at risk of hosting an eavesdropper. Full trust is typically established at this level 
            among users and with the network elements. Note that Full trust in this context is
            referring to the MAC address persistency. It does not extend to full trust between applications or devices.
            The device trusts the access point and all layer-2 domain entities beyond the access point,
            where the Wi-Fi transmissions can be detected, there is no guarantee that an eavesdropper will not observe
            the communications. As such, it is common to assume that, even in this environment, attackers may still be able
            to monitor the unencrypted information such as MAC addresses. If a device decided to not fully trust the
            network, it might apply any necessary policy to protect its identity. Most devices in the network only require 
            simple connectivity so that the network services are simple. For network support, it is also simple. It is usually 
            related to Internet connectivity.</li>

            <li>Managed residential settings: examples of this type of environments include shared living facilities
            and other collective environments where an operator manages the network for the residents. The OTA
            exposure is similar to (A). The operator may be requested to provide IT support to the residents and may need to 
            identify a device activity in real-time. It may also need to analyze logs. The infrastructure is shared and covers
            a larger area than (A), 
            residents may connect to the network from different locations. For example, they may regularly connect to the 
            network from their own apartments.
            They may occasionally connect to the network from common areas. The device may decide to use different pseudo-persistent 
            MAC address as we described in <xref target="trust" />. As such, the trust degree is Selective trust. In this environment, 
            the network services will be slightly more complex than (A). Network may be segmented by locations and multiple SSID. 
            User's devices should be able to join the
            network without pre-certification and pre-approval. In most cases, users only need simple connectivity; thus, 
            network support will be slightly but not significantly more complicated than (A).</li>

            <li>Public guest networks: public hotspots in shopping malls, hotels, stores, train stations,
            and airports are typical examples of this environment. 
            In this environment, trust is commonly not established with any element of the layer-2 broadcast domain. 
            Users do not anticipate a public guest network using the MAC address information to identify their location and 
            network activity. They do not trust the network and do not want the network
            to memorize them permanently. The trust degree is Zero. Devices in this network should avoid using long-lived
            MAC address to prevent fingerprinting. For example, the device may use a different MAC address every time
            it attaches to a new Wi-Fi access point. Some guest network operators may legally abide to
            identify devices. They should not use the MAC address for such function. Most users
            connecting to public guest network only expect simple Internet connectivity services, so the network
            services are simple. If users have issue to connect to the network or to access the Internet, they expect
		      limited to no technical support. Thus, the network support level is low.</li>
            
            <li>Enterprises with Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): 
            this type of networks are similar to (B) except that the onboarding devices are subjected to 
            pre-approval and pre-certification. The devices are usually personal devices and are not under the 
            control of the corporate IT team. Compared to residential network, enterprise network usually
            provides more sophisticated network services including but not
            limited to application-based network policies and identity-based network policies. Change of MAC address may
            interrupt network services if the services are based on MAC address. Thus, network operations will be more complex, 
            so the network support level is high.</li>
               
            <li>Managed enterprises: in this environment:
            this type of networks are similar to (C). The main difference is the devices are owned and managed by 
            the enterprise. Given the network and the devices are owned and managed by the enterprise, the trust 
            degree is Full trust. Network
            services and network support level are same as (D)

         <name>Network Services</name>
         <t>Different network environments provide different levels of network services, from simple to complex.
         At its simplest level, a network can provide a wireless connecting device basic IP communication service (e.g., 
         DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131" /> or SLAAC <xref target="RFC4862" />)
         and an ability to connect to the Internet (e.g., DNS service or relay, and routing in and out through a local gateway).
         The network can also offer more advanced services, such as managed instant messaging service, file storage, printing, 
         and/or local web service. Larger and more
         complex networks can also incorporate more advanced services, from AAA to AR/VR applications. To the network, its top 
         priority is to provide the best Quality of Experience to its users. Often the network contains policies which help to
         make forwarding decision based on the network conditions, the device, and the user identity associated to the device.
         For example, in a hospital private network, the network may contain policy to give highest priority to
         doctors' Voice-Over-IP packets. In another example, an enterprise network may contain policy
         to allow applications from a group of authenticated devices to use ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/> for congestion and/or 
         DSCP <xref target="RFC8837"/> for classification to signal the network for specific network policy. In this configuration,
         the network is required to associate the data packets to an identity to validate the legitimacy of the marking. 
         Before RCM, many network systems use
         MAC address as a persistent identity to create an association between user and device. After RCM being implemented, 
         the association is broken. 
         </t>

         <section anchor="DevID" numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Device Identification and Associated Problems</name>

            <t>Wireless access points and controllers use the MAC address to validate the device connection
            context, including protocol capabilities, confirmation that authentication was completed, Quality of Service 
            or security profiles, and encryption keying material. Some advanced access points and controllers also include
            upper layer functions whose purpose is covered below. A device changing its MAC address, without
            another recorded device identity, would cause the access point and the controller to lose the
            relation between a connection context and the corresponding device.
            As such, the layer-2 infrastructure does not know that the device (with its new MAC address)
            is authorized to communicate through the network. The encryption keying material is not identified
            anymore (causing the access point to fail to decrypt the device packets and fail to select the
            right key to send encrypted packets to the device). In short, the entire context needs to be
            rebuilt, and a new session restarted. The time consumed by this procedure breaks any flow that
            needs continuity or short delay between packets on the device (e.g., real-time audio, video,
            AR/VR, etc.). For example: <xref target="IEEE_802.11i"/>
            recognizes that a device may leave and re-join the network
            after a short time window.  As such, the standard suggests that the
            infrastructure should keep the context for a device for a while after
            the device was last seen. The device should maintain the same MAC address in such scenario.</t>


            <t>Some network equipment such as Multi-Layer routers and Wi-Fi Access Points which serve both 
            layer-2 and layer-3 in the same device rely on ARP <xref target="RFC826"/>, and NDP <xref target="RFC4861"/>, 
            to build the MAC-to-IP table for packet forwarding. 
            The size of the MAC address cache in the layer-2 switch is finite. 
            If new entries are created
            faster than the old entries flushed by the idle timer, it is possible to cause unintentional 
            deny-of-service attack. For example, default timeout of MAC address cache in Linux is set to 300s.
            Aggressive MAC randomization from many devices in a short
            time interval (e.g., less than 300s) may cause the layer-2 switch to exhaust its resources, holding in memory
            traffic for a device whose entry can no longer be found. For the RCM device, these 
            effects translate into session discontinuity and disrupt the active sessions. The discontinuity impact
            may vary. Real-time applications such as video conference may experience
            short interruption while non-real-time applications such as video streaming may experience minimal or no impact.
            The device should carefully balance when to change the MAC address after analyzing the nature of the running applications and its
            privacy policy.</t>

            <t>In wireless contexts, <xref target="IEEE_802.1X"/> authenticators rely on the device and 
            user identity validation provided by an AAA server to change the interface from a blocking state to 
            a forwarding state. The MAC address is used to verify that the device is in the authorized list, 
            and to retrieve the associated key used to decrypt the
            device traffic. A change in MAC address causes the port to be closed to the device data traffic
            until the AAA server confirms the validity of the new MAC address. Consequently, MAC address 
            randomization can disrupt the device traffic and strain the AAA server.</t>

            <t>DHCPv4 servers <xref target="RFC2131"/>, without a unique identification of the device, lose track of 
            which IP address is
            validly assigned. Unless the RCM device releases the IP address before changing its MAC address,
            DHCPv4 servers are at risk of scope exhaustion, causing new devices (and RCM devices)
            to fail to obtain a new IP address. Even if the RCM device releases the IP address before
            changing the MAC address, the DHCPv4 server typically holds the released IP address for a certain duration,
            in case the leaving MAC returns. As the DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"/> server cannot know if 
            the release is due to a temporary
             disconnection or a MAC randomization, the risk of scope address exhaustion exists even in cases
            where the IP address is released.</t>

            <t>Network devices with self-assigned IPv6 addresses (e.g., with SLAAC defined in 
            <xref target="RFC4862" />) and devices using static IP addresses rely on mechanisms like Optimistic 
            Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) <xref target="RFC4429"/> and NDP <xref target="RFC4861"/>  
            for peer devices to establish the association between the target IP address
            and a MAC address, and these peers may cache this association in memory. Changing the MAC address, even
            at disconnection-reconnection phase, without changing the IP address, may disrupt the
            stability of these mappings for these peers, if the change occurs within the caching period. Note that 
            this behavior is against standard operation and existing privacy recommendations. Implementations must
            avoid changing MAC address while maintaining previously assigned IP address without consulting
            the network.</t>

            <t>Routers keep track of which MAC address is on which interface, so they can form the proper Data Link
            header when forwarding a packet to a segment where MAC addresses are used. MAC address randomization can cause MAC
            address cache exhaustion, but also the need for frequent Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Reverse
            Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) <xref target="RFC826"/>, Neighbor Solicitation and, Neighbor 
            Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"/> exchanges.</t>

            <t>In residential settings (environment type A in <xref target="environment" />), 
            policies can be in place to control the
            traffic of some devices (e.g., parental control or block-list filters). These policies are often 
            based on the device's MAC address. MAC address randomization removes the possibility for such control.</t>
            
            <t>In residential settings (environment type A) and in enterprises (environment types D and E),
            device recognition and ranging may be used for IoT-related functionalities (door unlock, preferred
            light and temperature configuration, etc.) These functions often rely on the detection of the
            device's wireless MAC address. MAC address randomization breaks the services based on such model.</t>
            
            <t>In managed residential settings (environment types B) and in enterprises (environment types
            D and E), the network operator is often requested to provide IT support. With
            MAC address randomization, real-time support is only possible if the user can provide the
            current MAC address. Service improvement support is not possible if the MAC address that
            the device had at the (past) time of the reported issue is not known at the time the issue
            is reported.</t>
            
            <t>In industrial environments, policies are associated with each group of objects, including IoT devices.
            MAC address randomization may prevent an IoT device from being identified properly, thus leading to
            network quarantine and disruption of operations.</t>

	   <name>802.1X with WPA2 / WPA3</name>
	      
	   <t>In typical enterprise Wi-Fi environment, 802.1X authentication <xref target="IEEE_802.1X"/> coupled with
      WPA2 or WPA3 <xref target="IEEE_802.11i"/> encryption schemes are commonly used for onboarding a Wi-Fi device. 
      This allows the mutual identification of the client device or the user of the device and an 
      authentication authority. The authentication exchange does not occur in clear text, and the user or the device 
      identity can be concealed from unauthorized observers. However, the authentication authority is in 
      most cases under the control of the same entity as the network access provider. This may lead to expose the user 
      or device identity to the network owner.</t>
	      
	   <t>This scheme is well-adapted to enterprise environment, where a level of trust is established between the user 
      and the enterprise network operator. In this scheme, MAC address randomization can occur through brief disconnections and 
      reconnections (under the rules of <xref target="IEEE_802.11bh"/>). Authentication may then need to reoccur, with an associated 
      cost of service 
      disruption and additional load on the enterprise infrastructure, and an associated benefit of limiting the exposure of a 
      continuous MAC address to external observers. The adoption of this scheme is limited outside of the enterprise 
      environment by the requirement to install an authentication profile on the end device, which would be recognized and accepted 
      by a local authentication authority and its authentication server. Such a server is uncommon in a home environment, and the 
      procedure to install a profile is cumbersome for most untrained users.
      The likelihood that a user or device profile would match a profile recognized by 
      a public Wi-Fi authentication authority is also fairly limited. This may restrict the adoption of this scheme for public 
      Wi-Fi as well. Similar limitations are found in hospitality environment. Hospitality environment refers to space provided 
      by hospitality industry, which includes but not limited to hotels, stadiums, restaurants, concert halls and hospitals.

      <section anchor="OpenRoaming" numbered="true" toc="default">
	   <name>OpenRoaming</name>
      <t> In order to alleviate some of the limitations listed above, the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA) OpenRoaming 
      Standard introduces an intermediate trusted relay between local venues (places where some public Wi-Fi is available)
      and sources of identity  
      <xref target="I-D.tomas-openroaming" />. The federation structure extends the type of authorities that can be 
      used as identity sources (compared to traditional enterprise-based 802.1X <xref target="IEEE_802.1X"/> scheme for Wi-Fi), 
      and facilitates the 
      establishment of trust between local networks and an identity provider. Such a procedure increases the likelihood 
      that one or more identity profiles for the user or the device will be recognized by a local network. At the same time, 
      authentication does not occur to the local network. This may offer the possibility for the user or the device to keep 
      their identity obfuscated from the local network operator, unless that operator specifically expresses the requirement to 
      disclose such identity (in which case the user has the option to accept or decline the connection and associated identity exposure).</t>

      <t>The OpenRoaming scheme seems well-adapted to public Wi-Fi and hospitality environment. It defines a framework to protect 
      the identity from unauthorized entities while to permit mutual authentication between the device or the user 
      and a trusted identity provider. Just like with standard 802.1X <xref target="IEEE_802.1X"/> scheme for Wi-Fi, 
      authentication allows for the establishment of WPA2 or WPA3 keys <xref target="IEEE_802.11i"/> that can then 
      be used to encrypt the communication between the device and the access point. The encryption adds extra protection
      to prevent the network traffic from being eavesdropped.</t>
	
      <t>MAC address randomization can occur through brief disconnections and reconnections 
      (under the rules of <xref target="IEEE_802.11bh"/>). Authentication may then need to reoccur, with an associated cost of service disruption and 
      additional load on the venue and identity provider infrastructure, and an associated benefit of limiting the exposure of a 
      continuous MAC address to external observers. Limitations of this scheme include the requirement to first install one or more profiles 
      on the client device. This scheme also requires the local network to support RADSEC <xref target="RFC6614"/>
      and the relay function, which may not be common in small hotspot networks and home environment.</t>

      <t>It is worth noting that, as part of collaborations between IETF MADINAS and WBA around OpenRoaming, some RADIUS privacy 
      enhancements have been proposed in the IETF RADEXT group. For instance, <xref target="I-D.ietf-radext-deprecating-radius"/>
      describes good practices in the use of Chargeable-User-Identity (CUI) between different visited networks, making it better 
      suited for Public Wi-Fi and Hospitality use cases.</t>

	<section anchor="Proprietary" numbered="true" toc="default">
	   <name>Proprietary RCM schemes</name>
	   <t> Most client device operating system vendors offer RCM schemes, enabled by default (or easy to enable) on client devices. 
      With these schemes, the device changes its MAC address, when not associated, after having used a given MAC address for a 
      semi-random duration window. These schemes also allow for the device to manifest a different MAC address in different SSIDs.</t>

	   <t>Such a randomization scheme enables the device to limit the duration of exposure of a single MAC address to observers. 
         In <xref target="IEEE_802.11bh"/>, MAC address randomization is not allowed during a given association session, and MAC 
         address randomization can only 
         occur through disconnection and reconnection. Authentication may then need to reoccur, with an associated cost of service disruption and 
         additional load on the venue and identity provider infrastructure, directly proportional to the frequency of the randomization. The scheme 
         is also not intended to protect from the exposure of other identifiers to the venue network (e.g., DHCP option 012 [host name] visible to the 
         network between the AP and the DHCPv4 server). </t>
